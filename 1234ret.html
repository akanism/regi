Benjamin was so moved by her experience that he went to comfort the cow and lay with her, holding the grieving mom while she went through every parentâs worst nightmare. His actions were caught on camera and shared on social media alongside the words: âWhat a great heart this man has. This momma cow lost her baby yesterday and Benjamin laid with her and petted her to try and comfort her. Such a sweet yet heartbreaking picture.â Hour of need Benjamin told local media he had saw the cow fall to the ground during labor and the calf had been stillborn.
